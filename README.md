# JailBreak: Unknown's Cut
For a long time in Garry's Mod, there hasn't been a default gamemode based on the concept of JailBreak. In the workshop, you could only find a small number of low-quality addons that could provide you with an experience of this wonderful mode. But with the release of this version, we hope that JailBreak will shine in new colors.
